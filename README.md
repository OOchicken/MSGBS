Mobile Suit Gundam Battle System
================================

Welcome to the Mobile Suit Gundam Battle System (MSGBS), an exciting miniatures game for 2 or more players, in which teams can act out the battles of the One Year War from the Anime "Mobile Suit Gundam". Each player commands a team of bipedal armored vehicles called mobile suits, fighting to complete various objectives on the game board. The rules for MSGBS are based on the rules of the popular "Warhammer 40,000" game system.

If you're new to github, here's a great "getting started" reference.

.docx in github? Are you crazy?
-------------------------------

Well, yeah, but not for that reason. Github has great community involvement tools and utilities that we wanted to leverage. While we can't use git's diff tools, Word includes its own suite of file comparasson, and neither of us particularly wants to learn a typesetting script like LaTeX.

Here's how to compare 2 documents in Microsoft Word, taken directly from MSWord's help resource.

1. Open one of the two versions of the document that you want to compare.
2. On the Tools menu, point to Track Changes, and then click Compare Documents.
3. On the Original document pop-up menu, select the original document.
4. On the Revised document pop-up menu, browse to the other version of the document, and then click OK. Changes from the revised copy are merged into a new copy that is based on the original copy of the document. The original copy remains untouched. Revision marks show any differences introduced by the revised copy of the document.


How can I help?

Be active on Github. Propose changes and issues. A contribution guide is comming soon, so you'll be able to propose changes to the files themselves.
